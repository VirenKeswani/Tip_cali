# Tip_cali
Created a baisc calculator in which you can calculate the amount and then when u get the total amount you can click on tip and use the slider to get the tip amount , you can also type a number which will calculate the people you want to split with. When you click the '=' button on the tip screen the amount would split with the number of people entered.
